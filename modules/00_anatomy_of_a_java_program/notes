Anatomy of a Java Program

Function:
· A block of code that performs a task
· What it looks like:

ReturnType Name() {
  ...
}

· If a function returns nothing, it's return type is void
· Every Java program should have at least one function.
  - i.e. main()

 
Class:
· A container of one or more functions
· What it looks like:
  class Main {

    ReturnType Name() {
      ...
    }

    main() {
      ...
    }
  }

Note: a function that is part of a class is known as a method

Note: classes and functions in Java need to have access modifiers defined.
· This looks like:
  public class Main {

    public void main() {
      ...
    }

    public ReturnType Name() {
      ...
    }
  } 

Note: when naming classes, use the PascalNamingConvention
Note: when naming a method, use camelNamingConvention
